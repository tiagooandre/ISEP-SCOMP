|  SIGNAL |   NUMBER   |                                        ACTION                                       |
|:-------:|:----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  SIGHUP |      1     | End the process. SIGHUP (“hang-up”) signal is used to report that the user's terminal is disconnected. |
|  SIGINT |      2     | End the process. Interruption generated when doing CTRL + C on the keyboard.        |
| SIGQUIT |      3     | End the process. SIGQUIT it's controlled by a the QUIT character and produces a core dump when it terminates the process. |
|  SIGILL |      4     | End the process. Illegal instruction. The program contain some machine code the CPU don't understand. |
| SIGABRT |      6     |          The program call the abort() function. It's an emergency stop.             |
| SIGTRAP |      5     |       Generated by the machine’s breakpoint instruction, and possibly other trap instructions. This signal is used by debuggers. |
|  SIGFPE |      8     |               Reports a fatal arithmetic error.                   |
| SIGKILL |      9     | Is used to cause immediate program termination. It cannot be handled or ignored, and is therefore always fatal. It is also not possible to block this signal.            |
| SIGSEGV |     11     | Is generated when a program tries to read or write outside the memory that is allocated for it, or to write memory that can only be read.               |
| SIGPIPE |     13     |       Broken pipe.       |
| SIGALRM |     14     |                Typically indicates expiration of a timer that measures real or clock time.              |
| SIGTERM |     15     | Is a generic signal used to cause program termination. Unlike SIGKILL, this signal can be blocked, handled, and ignored.                   |
| SIGUSR1 | 10, 16, 30 |     End the process. The SIGUSR1 is set for you to use any way you want.                          |
| SIGUSR2 | 12, 17, 31 |     End the process. The SIGUSR2 is set for you to use any way you want.                          |
| SIGCHLD | 17, 18, 20 |           This signal is sent to a parent process whenever one of its child processes terminates or stops.                          |
| SIGCONT | 18, 19, 25 |                      If the process was stopped then a signal is sent to continue.                     |
| SIGSTOP | 17, 19, 23 |                                    Stops the process.                                  |
| SIGTSTP | 18, 20, 24 |                   Is an interactive stop signal. Unlike SIGSTOP, this signal can be handled and ignored.                  |
| SIGTTIN |   21, 26   |              A process cannot read from the user’s terminal while it is running as a background job.               |
| SIGTTOU |   22, 27   |              This is similar to SIGTTIN, but is generated when a process in a background job attempts to write to the terminal              |
